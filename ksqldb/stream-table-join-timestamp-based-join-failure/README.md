# Stream-Table Joins: Stream events must be timestamped after the Table records

## Objective

With stream-table join, your table messages *must* already exist (and must be timestamped) before the stream messages. If you re-emit your source stream messages, after the table topic is populated, the join will succeed. See Resources section below for more examples.

## How to run

Simply run:

```
$ playground run -f start<use tab key to activate fzf completion (see https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/cli?id=%e2%9a%a1-setup-completion), otherwise use full path, or correct relative path>
```
