## Objective

See how we can group a time series of events into variable-size, non-overlapping time intervals based on a configurable inactivity period

## How to run

```
$ playground run -f start<use tab key to activate fzf completion (see https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/cli?id=%e2%9a%a1-setup-completion), otherwise use full path, or correct relative path>
```
