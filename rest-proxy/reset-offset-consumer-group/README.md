# How to reset an offset for a specific consumer group using the REST Proxy

## Objective

As described in [Consumer groups](https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/consumer.html#consumer-groups), the progress of a consumer group is stored in an internal topic called `__consumer_offsets`. Once a consumer group is resumed, the next offset to be read from a topic/partition is retrieved from the `__consumer_offsets` and the consumers would continue to read from where the group left off.

There may be a requirement from a REST consumer to re-consume some of the old messages or skip messages until a specific date/time that are produced to a Kafka topic.



## How to run

Simply run:

```
$ playground run -f start<use tab key to activate fzf completion (see https://kafka-docker-playground.io/#/cli?id=%e2%9a%a1-setup-completion), otherwise use full path, or correct relative path>
```
